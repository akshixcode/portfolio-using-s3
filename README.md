# portfolio-using-s3
Organize your static files: index.html, CSS, JS, images, etc.

Ensure your entry point is index.html.
This project demonstrates a simple yet effective approach to hosting a static portfolio using Amazon S3. All frontend assets—including HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and media files—are organized and deployed to an S3 bucket configured for public access and static website hosting. By enabling the appropriate bucket policy and setting index.html as the entry point, the site becomes accessible via a public endpoint, offering a lightweight and scalable solution for showcasing personal projects. This setup eliminates the need for traditional web servers and leverages AWS's reliability and global infrastructure to deliver content efficiently.
